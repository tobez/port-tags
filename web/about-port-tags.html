<h1>Port-tags version 0.11 &alpha; (alpha)</h1>

<p>
<a href="/port-tags/">Port-tags</a> is like
<a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> for
FreeBSD ports collection.
</p>

<p>
On a theory that one picture is worth a thousand words,
here is a <a href="/port-tags-usage-example.html">typical port-tags usage example</a>.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to make ports classification easier and more convenient.
Instead of using predefined and limited set of port categories, port-tags
uses short one-word descriptions called <strong>tags</strong>.  A port can have
an arbitrary number of tags associated with it.  One can use the web interface
(and maybe a command-line interface in the future) to view only the ports that
have particular tags associated with them.  This process is very efficient in
narrowing down the number of sought ports.
</p>

<p>
For those unfamiliar with the concept of tagging:
please note that just selecting a single tag
from the monstrous tag list
does not buy you much.
For example, by selecting <code>devel</code> tag,
the resulting subset of ports with this tag consists of
more than 2000 ports, which is substantially
higher than even the size of notoriously huge <code>devel</code>
category!
</p>

<p>
The real power of tagging manifests itself when you limit
the subset even more by adding more tags to the query.
This is normally done by clicking on one of the "Related tags"
in the upper right of the page.
For example, selecting <code>mail</code> in addition to
already selected <code>devel</code> tag
will produce just 17 results, which is much more manageable.
</p>

<p>
In this way one can very quickly find just those ports
in which one has interest at the moment.
</p>

<p>
There is a mailing list, which currently combines port-tags
discussions with commit messages to port-tags system.
To subscribe to it, send a mail to
<a href="mailto:port-tags+subscribe@list.droso.net">port-tags+subscribe@list.droso.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
The source code for port-tags can be fetched from SVN repository at
<a href="http://svn.droso.net/svn/port-tags/trunk">http://svn.droso.net/svn/port-tags/trunk</a>.
You will need either subversion client
(<a href="http://www.freshports.org/devel/subversion/"><code>devel/subversion</code></a>)
or an alternative, better client svk
(<a href="http://www.freshports.org/devel/svk/"><code>devel/svk</code></a>).
</p>

<p>
Debian has something similar called <a href="http://debtags.alioth.debian.org/">Debtags</a>.
The main difference of Debtags and port-tags is not the absense
or presense of particular frontends.  Rather, Debtags takes potentially
more fruitful approach of getting the community to define the tags, while
for now, port-tags uses an algorithmic approach to deduce the tags from
the existing categories and from ports' COMMENT field.  Let's see how
this works out and extend it to a community-based project at a later stage.
</p>

<p>
The idea of port-tags came up in a conversation I had with
<a href="http://www.autrijus.org/">Autrijus Tang</a> a couple of weeks
ago.  Since then, I discussed it with various people (most notably
with Lars Thegler, Erwin Lansing, and Florent Thoumie)
and finally implemented it.
</p>

<p>
In its current form, the service is not updated live.
Instead, as it depends on the INDEX file, and the index file gets
updated once a day, so does the port-tags database.
</p>

<p>
If it looks too similar to del.icio.us, it is because for this early
version I just stole the stylesheets from there.
</p>

<p>
As of version 0.04 &alpha;,
you can download the <a href="/port-tags/port-tags.db">generated database</a>
that port-tags use.
Or you can download a simple
<a href="/port-tags/TAGS.bz2">textual database of tags</a>
instead.
Thanks to Michael C. Shultz for the idea.
</p>

<p>
As of version 0.05 &alpha;,
you can use a <a href="/api-port-tags.html">simple API</a> to get just the
newline-separated list of ports with specified tags.
Thanks to Panagiotis Astithas for the idea.
</p>

<p>
As of version 0.10 &alpha;,
you can use a <a href="/api-port-tags.html">simple API</a> to get the
newline-separated list of related tags.
Thanks to Alexander Botero-Lowry for the idea.
</p>

<p>
As of version 0.11 &alpha;,
you can use a <a href="/api-port-tags.html">simple API</a> to get the
newline-separated list of tags for a given port.
Thanks to Alexander Botero-Lowry for the idea.
</p>

<p>
If you have any comments and suggestions with regard to port-tags,
I would like to hear about it.  Is it useful?
How can we make it <strong>more</strong> useful?
What are the shortcomings?  Any show-stoppers which prevent
<strong>you</strong> from using it?
