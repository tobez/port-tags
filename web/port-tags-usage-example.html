<h1>Port-tags usage example</h1>

<p>
Here is a typical port-tags screen without any tags selected:
</p>

<img title="port-tags entry screen" src="/images/port-tags1.png">

<p>
On the left is a sample of FreeBSD ports, and on the right is
the <strong>tag cloud</strong>.
The tags in the cloud are alphabetically sorted.
The font size and tag color saturation represent the fact
that different tags apply to different number of ports each.
</p>

<p>
I highlighted one tag, <strong>apache</strong>, in the picture above.
Let's suppose that we are interested in apache-related FreeBSD
ports, and click on the tag:
</p>

<img title="port-tags apache screen" src="/images/port-tags2.png">

<p>
Now on the left we can only see those FreeBSD ports
that have <strong>apache</strong> tag attached to them.
There are still 146 of them,
far too many than is comfortable to browse through,
but better than the original whopping 13614.
</p>

<p>
There is something new on the right, too.
At the upper right there is a new cloud
(in different color)
which only shows those tags that are attached
to some of the ports also tagged with <strong>apache</strong>.
The usual, complete tag cloud is still there, it is just not visible
on the screenshot.
</p>

<p>
Let's supposed that we are interested in all apache-related
FreeBSD ports that are also somehow related to load-balancing
(I also highlighted the <strong>balancer</strong> tag in the previous
screenshot).  When we click on it, we get:
</p>

<img title="port-tags apache+balancer screen" src="/images/port-tags3.png">

<p>
So we conveniently limited our browsing to (hopefully)
exactly what we were looking for.
